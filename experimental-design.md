**Objective**: Does a group challenge increase the number of steps people take?


### Classic Statistical Considerations
- Effect size [insert research here ] ==> number


### SoMe Considerations
-- What is a group? [FB groups vs friends in physical world];
-- How are {messages|posts} shared? (What are the patterns of commenting?) (Maybe a separate paper)
-- Named challenges?
-- How to track dynamics of group membership?  (Maybe a separate paper)
-- spillover; 
-- establishing exposure (GPS tracker, introduces the biases of who likes to always be tracked, sharing of phones)
-- access to smartphone, where running (time of day, locations)

### Outcome measures

| Group  | Steps Taken |
|--:|:--|
